###Android Studio
1. Download the latest version of Android Studio along with SDK Tools from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html. Follow all the default instructions when installing. If Android Studio asks you to open SDK Manager, do NOT open it yet. Do not check the box to open Android Studio yet.

###ftc_app
1. In order to use your FTC Robot, you need the official FTC SDK to program your robot. You can find the zip to download the FTC SDK from https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/archive/master.zip. Save the file to a place which you can easily access it from later, and where it won't be deleted accidentally (this is where you will store your robot's code as well). Unzip the file.
